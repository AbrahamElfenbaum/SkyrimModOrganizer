TO DO:                                                                                                         | STATUS:
1. Complete the Add, Edit and Remove Mod functions, and any helper functions needed for them to work correctly | IN PROGRESS
2. See if ther is a way to change all of the strings in the SSEMod struct into const char*		       | IN PROGRESS
3. See if ther is a way to encode the names, authors and links into smaller codes and back again	       | IN PROGRESS
4. Find blocks of repeated code and see if they can be made into functions to avoid duplication		       | IN PROGRESS
5. Look to see if there are other ways to make the code more efficient/elegant				       | IN PROGRESS

Known Issues:
-If the user presses enter and the code is expecting an integer, the cursor will go to the next line and the code will not
continue until something is typed into the consol and enter is pressed
-There is nothing stopping a mod to be a dependency of itself - DONE
Future Plans:
-Add bool mIsDependency field to the SSEMod struct. It will be false by default. And if it becomes a dependnecy to a mod,
it will be set to true. This will be a check to see if a mod can be freely edited and/or deleted when those functions are
created
-Comment the code to make it understandable to other people reading it
-Make test cases to make testing the code easier
-Color the text so that each aspect of the mod is a bit more distinguishable
-Add bool mEnabled field to the SSEMod struct. A mod can be installed, but not enabled - DONE
-Replace/modify adding to the ModList Vector so that the contents of the list are saved. As the code is now, the user
would need to re-enter in every mod they want on their list each time they start up the program
-Make an actual UI. This will not only make the program look better, but it may even solve some issues I'm having
